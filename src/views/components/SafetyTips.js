        <h3>To ensure your safety while shopping</h3>

          <li>Do not leave your car unoccupied with the motor running or with children or pets inside.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water safety tips</h3>
        <p>The risk of drowning tragically increases with hot weather, and drowning can occur anywhere and to anyone. It is important to constantly assess any potential risks around water, particularly where children are concerned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure children have an adult present when swimming.</li>
          <li>When you are entertaining a group of children or adults, have a designated water watcher who is responsible for keeping track of everyone.</li>
          <li>Never leave children unattended in or around pools - not even for a second.</li>
          <li>Only swim in a public pool or ocean if there is a lifeguard on duty.</li>
          <li>Never dive into the water unless the lifeguard says it is safe to do so.</li>
          <li>Never run along the edge of a swimming pool or push people in.</li>
          <li>Stay away from diving boards when in the pool.</li>
          <li>Always keep chairs and tables away from the pool fence to keep children from using them to climb over the fence.</li>
          <li>Do not allow anyone of any age to swim alone - drowning happens to adults too.</li>
        </ul>
